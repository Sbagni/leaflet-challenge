The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment;
and the impacts of climate and land-use. A sample screenshot of the data:

The USGS  collects a massive amount of data all over the world each day.This aim of this project was to visualise their earthquake data.
